<h1>TOP 10 COUNTRIES LEADING THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RACE:</h1>
<font size="5">
<p><b>Merely</b>one mention of artificial intelligence invokes the pictures of robots, chatbots, or self-driving cars. <b>Artificial intelligenc</b>e, a branch of computer science deals with devising technology and machines that are capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence. AI is everywhere and it has not stepped down since its invasion. <b>The</b> new decade will witness massive investments by global technology giants into AI technologies.</p>
<p><b>In</b> the race to acquire and develop the most efficient and ingenious technologies, countries worldwide have been setting guidelines and investing immensely in the field of AI. Following are the statistics of the global<b> AI readiness Inde</b>x conducted by Oxford Insights and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) in 2019. The index covers 194 countries and territories and ranks them according to their preparedness to implement AI in the delivery of public services and internal operations. Each country is allocated a score that considers 11 input metrics under 4 clusters: governance, infrastructure and data, skills and education, and government and public services. The report suggests that the rankings are dominated by countries that have robust economies, an abundance of data and information, and a government with a strong vision.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Singapore comes first in the list of artificial intelligence readiness with a score of 9.186.</li>
    <li>The top 20 positions are acquired by Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and some European countries, and Asian countries. China, currently 21<sup>st</sup> in the global rankings will improve in the upcoming years because of the governmentâ€™s inclination to optimize data and artificial intelligence.</li>
    <li>Most of the countries in North America were awarded higher ranks in the list while the African and Asia-Pacific regions were the worst performers.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><strong>India </strong>stands third in the Asia Pacific region after Singapore and Hong Kong and 19<sup>th</sup> in the global index overall. According to surveys, it is one of the most prepared economies with regard to government readiness to artificial intelligence. But despite this availability, it lacks creativity, innovation, and awareness which are the reasons behind Indian start-ups lagging behind those of the American and other developed countries. 76% of start-ups in India believe that there is a dearth of skilled professionals in the field of AI and hence hesitate from using these technologies in their business. But the established companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple are employing AI technologies like deep learning, language processing, and machine learning and are acquiring start-ups to provide new and improved experiences across their services.</li>
