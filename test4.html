<h1>Pros and Cons of Artificial Intelligence – A Threat or a Blessing?</h1>

<FONT SIZE="5">
<P><B>Everything</B> in excess is dangerous and so is the case with Artificial Intelligence. It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, that makes it significant.
</P>
<P><B>With</B> the simulation of human intelligence, processes by machines that are especially computer systems include learning the acquisition of information and rules for using it. The reasoning uses rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions and self-correction.
</P>
<P><B>THERE</B>is no doubt in saying that technology is an essential part of the development and growth of humans. A thin line or mistake leads to disruption or destruction.</P>

    <h4 class="fittexted_for_content_h4" style="font-size: 20.63px;">1. To ‘err’ is human, so why not use AI?</h4>


    <p>Machine take decision based on previous data records. With algorithms, the chances of errors are reduced. This is an achievement, as solving complex problems require difficult calculation that can be done without any error.</p>
    <p>Business organizations use digital assistants to interact with their users, this helps them to save an ample amount of time. The demand for user’s businesses is fulfilled and thus they don’t have to wait. They are programmed to give the best possible assistance to a user.</p>

<p><strong>For example –</strong> Heard of Mars Orbiter Mission, or the movie Mission Mangal, which is based on it? How are they reaching to such great heights? The first reason being the human brain and the second being artificial intelligence.</p>


<p>There is no room for error with artificial intelligence. The robots are fed with information that is sent to explore space. Metal bodies have more resistant and a great ability to endure the space and hostile atmosphere.</p>

<p>They are created and used in such a way that they cannot be modified or get disfigured or breakdown in a hostile environment.</p>


<h4 class="fittexted_for_content_h4" style="font-size: 20.63px;">2. AI doesn’t get tired and wear out easily</h4>

<p>Artificial Intelligence and the science of robotics is used in mining and other fuel exploration processes. These complex machines help to explore the ocean floor and overcome human limitations.</p>

<p>Due to the programming of the robots, they can perform a more laborious task with extra hard work and with greater responsibility. Moreover, they do not wear out easily.</p>


<h4 class="fittexted_for_content_h4" style="font-size: 20.63px;">3. Digital assistance helps in day to day chores</h4>

<p>Siri listens to us and performs the task in one tap. GPS helps you to travel the world. How can I forget the basic necessity? Food, clothing, shelter, and smartphone. They are the ones that predict what we are going to type, in short, they know us better than anyone.</p>

<p>The best is the autocorrect feature, it understands what you are trying to say and present you the sentence in the best way possible. Have you observed that while you post a picture on social media, you tag people, but the machine automatically detects the person’s face and tags that individuals?</p>

<p>Same is when you work on Google Photos. Automatically, a folder is created of the people with the help of their faces.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is widely employed by financial institutions and banking institutions because it helps to organize and manage data. Also, detection of fraud uses artificial intelligence in a smart card-based system.</p>

<h4 class="fittexted_for_content_h4" style="font-size: 20.63px;">4. Rational decision maker</h4>

<p>Logic above all! Highly advanced organizations have digital assistants which help them to interact with the users and save the need for human resources.</p>

<p>Right program decisions can be taken if they are worked upon rationally. But, with humans, emotions come along. When artificial thinkers, there is no distraction at all. They don’t have an emotional side, and that makes robots think logically.</p>

<p>Emotions are not associated with them and therefore the mood doesn’t hamper the efficiency. Thus they are always productive.</p>
